# okman's favourite challenge writeups

Basically, I have years of CTF challenges and HTB machines backlogged that I've never published writeups for - so I've decided to publish some of them here, starting with writeups for my favourite challenges. If I ever get around to it....

TODO: actually add the rest of my favourite challenges \(lazy\)

I usually participate in CTFs solo, so I have way too many challenges to write stuff up for - so if everyone who reads this collectively decides they hate my writeups, I can use my time less productively!
